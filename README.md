# ⚽ Footballers – Data Driven Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how data can be used to evaluate football players from a performance and strategic perspective. The objective is to move beyond basic statistics and generate actionable insights that could support scouting, performance optimisation, and decision-making within football organisations.

The analysis focuses on identifying performance patterns, comparing player profiles, and understanding how data-driven metrics can contribute to more informed sporting and strategic decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyse player performance using advanced metrics
- Identify player profiles through statistical clustering
- Compare players across positions using normalised indicators
- Explore how data insights can support sporting and recruitment decisions
- Translate technical data into strategic insights

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes player-level statistics such as:

- Minutes played
- Goals / Assists
- Expected Goals (xG)
- Expected Assists (xA)
- Pass completion %
- Progressive passes
- Defensive actions
- Duels won
- Key passes

(Data source: public football datasets / FBref / StatsBomb open data)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for clustering)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Analysis

### 1️⃣ Player Performance Index
Created a composite performance indicator combining offensive, defensive, and playmaking metrics.

### 2️⃣ Clustering Model
Used K-Means clustering to group players based on performance characteristics rather than position labels.

### 3️⃣ Role Identification
Identified hidden player roles based on statistical behaviour rather than traditional tactical descriptions.

## 🧠 Strategic Perspective

Beyond technical analysis, this project explores how:

- Data can reduce subjectivity in scouting
- Performance indicators can support recruitment decisions
- Clustering models can help identify undervalued players
- Analytical frameworks can improve decision-making processes

The goal is not only to analyse data, but to understand how these insights could be applied within football organisations or consulting environments.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Incorporate tracking data
- Add predictive modelling (player performance forecasting)
- Build an interactive dashboard
- Integrate salary/value metrics for ROI analysis
